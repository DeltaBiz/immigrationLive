  <h1><?= $city; ?> Personal Injury Lawyers - defective and unsafe products</h1>
	
<p>Have you been injured in <?= $city; ?> because you used a a defective or unsafe product? Talk to a personal injury lawyer now, before you do anything else.!</p>

<h2>Not all products are safe!</h2>

<p>We assume that the products we purchase are safe. After all, before a product is put on the market it must comply with safety standards set by the government. But not all products are safe, and they have the potential to cause you serious harm.</p>

<p>Sometimes safety  standards are ignored, simply to achieve greater profits. Other times, a simple manufacturing malfunction causes a defect in the product, rendering it unsafe. Whether the manufacturer or distributor overlooked a products flaws on purpose, or missed them through neglect, won't matter to you if you've been injured.</p>

<h2>Don't contact the manufacturer or distributor</h2>

<p>You might be tempted to contact the product manufacturer. We recommend that you don't do that. Here's why:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to talk to the right person in the company, and you won't know who that person is;</li>
<li>You'll likely be offered far less that you should get. Something like a "product replacement"; or</li>
<li>You will simply be ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>A defective product / personal injury lawyer will use the proper channels to bring the resulting injury to the attention of the corporate personnel and let them know they may be facing a lawsuit.</p>

<h2>Talk to a defective product lawyer</h2>

<p>Seeking compensation for your injuries can be a complicated process, and it's a process you shouldn't try to do yourself. You should not make any decisions without being completely aware of your rights, and a lawyer can tell you what those rights are.</p>

<p>A lawyer will handle the process of your claim. Your lawyer will also make sure that the proper claim forms are submitted to the insurer. A lawyer will properly investigate your claim, and compile the necessary medical documentation needed to support your claim. If necessary, they will start the lawsuit process within the allotted time limits. A lawyer is especially important to have when you are dealing with insurance companies.</p>

<h2>Dealing with the Insurance Company</h2>

<p>Insurance companies have lawyers, and you should have one too. If not, you're a great disadvantage; and they know it!</p>

<p>Usually, the insurance company will send an insurance adjuster to speak with you about the accident and the injuries you sustained from it. Here are some important points to remember when you meet with the adjuster;
<ul>
	<li>Be aware that anything you say to the insurance adjuster will become part of your file, and may affect your future accident benefit claims;</li>
	<li>Only talk to the adjuster when you are medically able;</li>
	<li>Get legal advice before speaking with the adjuster. It is important to have a lawyer involved as early in the process as possible because anything you say to your insurance company can hurt you immediately or in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your lawyer will keep you informed of your rights and help you stay on a level playing field with the insurer.</p>
